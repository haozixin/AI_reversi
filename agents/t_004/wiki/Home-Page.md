## Introduction
In this project, our team "Plan for Plan" implemented two different AI agents to play the Reversi/Othello game. 
The first method is based on the **minimax algorithm(Alpha-Beta Pruning)**, which is a recursive algorithm that is used to find the optimal move for a player with a strong heuristic, 
assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. The second method is based on the **Monte Carlo Tree Search**, 
which is a combination of the minimax algorithm and Monte Carlo Algorithm that is used to find the optimal move for a player, 
assuming that the opponent plays randomly. The two methods are implemented in the folder `agents.t_004`. 
The two methods can be loaded in the file `myTeam.py` and `myTeam2.py` separately. 

This wiki will show you details about the two methods and the experiments we did. There are 4 sections:
1. [Home Page]()
2. [Approach One](AI-Method-1)
3. [Approach Two](AI-Method-2)
4. [Conclusions and Reflections](Conclusions-and-Reflections)

In the next section, we will show you the problem analysis of the two methods and explain which are the techniques that you choose and why.
To be more specific, our notes about this part of the project includes acknowledgement, comments, strengths and limitations, etc.  We would tell us how you used and how you applied the algorithms in our team.

In the Evolution and Experiments section, we will show you the experiments we did, the results we got, the evolution of our project and the improvements we made. 
Clearly show the way to become stronger through descriptions and tables

Some content will be in both section 2 and 3, such as an experimental section that justifies and explains the performance of the approaches implemented, including a table of results comparing the approaches implemented followed by a discussion.

Finally, in the *Conclusions and Reflections* section, we will point out the conclusions we got and the reflections we made. We also described the improvements we can make in the future.
